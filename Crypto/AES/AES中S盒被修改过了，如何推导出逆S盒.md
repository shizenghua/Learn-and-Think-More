# AES中S盒被修改过了，如何推导出逆S盒

一个程序，里边确定是AES加密，仅有加密函数，他的S盒被替换过了，那么如何求出逆S盒呢？

修改过的S盒如下

```
static const unsigned char sbox[256] = {
0x90,0x7A,0x50,0xEF,0xF0,0x9C,0x2F,0x7D,0xA0,0x34,0x23,0xCA,0x4F,0x21,0x66,0x6B,

首先要知道逆s盒和s盒是怎么用的，s盒的输入的高字节和低字节分别代表行号和列号，打个比方0x01输进s盒，那就取s盒的第0行第一列，按你贴出来的s盒得到的值就是0x7A
逆s盒的作用就是让上述过程可逆，也就是输入0x7A得到0x01，因此逆s盒的第7行第A列就是0x01。
写个脚本生成一下不难吧？
